# Python - Object-relational mapping :mortar_board:

## Learning Objectives :scroll:
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
* How to connect to a MySQL database from a Python script
* How to SELECT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
* How to INSERT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
* What ORM means
* How to map a Python Class to a MySQL table

## Requirements :white_check_mark:
### General
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* Your files will be executed with MySQLdb version 2.0.x
* Your files will be executed with SQLAlchemy version 1.4.x
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
* You are not allowed to use execute with sqlalchemy
